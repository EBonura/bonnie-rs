## Mission

Answer the question: **"How would a Souls-like have looked on a PS1?"**

## Core Pillars

1. **Unified Development Environment** - Every tool needed to create the game lives alongside the game itself. The editor, renderer, and game logic are one integrated package.

2. **Cross-Platform First** - Everything runs both in the browser (live demo) and locally (for planned Steam distribution). No compromises on either platform.

3. **Authentic PS1 Aesthetics** - Every feature serves the goal of recreating genuine PlayStation 1 hardware limitations and visual characteristics.

## Features

### Authentic PS1 Rendering
- **Affine texture mapping** - Characteristic warpy textures
- **Vertex snapping** - Jittery vertices at low precision
- **Gouraud shading** - Smooth per-vertex lighting
- **Low resolution** - Native 320x240 rendering
- **No perspective correction** - True to PS1 hardware limitations

### TR1-Style Level System
- **Room-based architecture** - Levels divided into connected rooms
- **Portal culling** - Only render visible rooms through portals
- **TRLE sector grid** - 1024-unit sectors for precise alignment
- **Textured geometry** - Multiple texture pack support

### Integrated Level Editor

#### Dual Viewport System
- **3D Viewport** - Real-time preview with authentic PS1 rendering
  - Camera controls (WASD + Q/E for height)
  - Vertex height editing (Y-axis only)
  - Face/edge/vertex selection with hover feedback

- **2D Grid View** - Top-down editing for precise layout
  - Sector-aligned floor/ceiling placement
  - Vertex position editing (X/Z plane)
  - Pan and zoom navigation

#### Editing Tools
- **Select Mode** - Pick and manipulate vertices, edges, and faces
- **Floor Tool** - Place 1024x1024 floor sectors
- **Ceiling Tool** - Place ceiling sectors at standard height
- **Wall Tool** - (Planned) Connect vertices to create walls
- **Texture Painting** - Click faces to apply selected texture
- **Vertex Linking** - Move coincident vertices together or independently

#### Texture Management
- Browse multiple texture packs
- Search and filter textures
- Auto-apply textures to new geometry
- Texture reference system (pack + name)

#### Workflow Features
- **Undo/Redo** - Full history for all edits
- **Cross-platform save/load**
  - Desktop: Native file dialogs
  - Browser: Import/Export JSON
- **Live preview** - Test levels with Play button
- **Status messages** - Contextual feedback for all operations
