## Mission

Answer the question: **"How would a Souls-like have looked on a PS1?"**

## Core Pillars

1. **Unified Development Environment** - Every tool needed to create the game lives alongside the game itself. The editor, renderer, and game logic are one integrated package.

2. **Cross-Platform First** - Everything runs both in the browser (live demo) and locally (for planned Steam distribution). No compromises on either platform.

3. **Authentic PS1 Aesthetics** - Every feature serves the goal of recreating genuine PlayStation 1 hardware limitations and visual characteristics.

## Features

### Authentic PS1 Rendering
- **Affine texture mapping** - Characteristic warpy textures
- **Vertex snapping** - Jittery vertices at low precision
- **Gouraud shading** - Smooth per-vertex lighting
- **Low resolution** - Native 320x240 rendering
- **No perspective correction** - True to PS1 hardware limitations

### TR1-Style Level System
- **Room-based architecture** - Levels divided into connected rooms
- **Portal culling** - Only render visible rooms through portals
- **TRLE sector grid** - 1024-unit sectors for precise alignment
- **Textured geometry** - Multiple texture pack support

### Modern Editor UI

The editor features a MuseScore-inspired interface design:

- **Tab-based navigation** - Fixed tabs for World Editor, Sound Designer, Tracker, and Game preview
- **Flat icon buttons** - Clean, minimal toolbar with [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icons
- **Cyan accent color** - Active state highlighting inspired by MuseScore 4
- **Unified toolbar** - All tools accessible in a single row
- **Tooltips** - Hover hints for all buttons

#### Dual Viewport System
- **3D Viewport** - Real-time preview with authentic PS1 rendering
  - Camera controls (WASD + Q/E for height)
  - Vertex height editing (Y-axis only)
  - Face/edge/vertex selection with hover feedback

- **2D Grid View** - Top-down editing for precise layout
  - Sector-aligned floor/ceiling placement
  - Vertex position editing (X/Z plane)
  - Pan and zoom navigation

#### Editing Tools
- **Select Mode** - Pick and manipulate vertices, edges, and faces
- **Floor Tool** - Place 1024x1024 floor sectors
- **Ceiling Tool** - Place ceiling sectors at standard height
- **Wall Tool** - (Planned) Connect vertices to create walls
- **Texture Painting** - Click faces to apply selected texture
- **Vertex Linking** - Move coincident vertices together or independently

#### Texture Management
- Browse multiple texture packs with chevron navigation
- ~800 textures across 4 included packs
- Auto-apply textures to new geometry
- Texture reference system (pack + name)
- WASM support via build-time manifest generation

#### Workflow Features
- **Undo/Redo** - Full history for all edits
- **Cross-platform save/load**
  - Desktop: Native file dialogs
  - Browser: Import/Export via download/upload
- **Live preview** - Test levels with Play button

## Backlog

### Overall / Meta

#### High Priority
- [x] Add author credit: "Created by Emanuele Bonura" with links to [GitHub](https://github.com/EBonura/bonnie-engine), [itch.io](https://bonnie-games.itch.io/), [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/bonniegames)
- [x] Expand Home page vision: clarify this could expand beyond Souls-like to RPG mechanics (FF Tactics style) or platformers
- [x] Add "will always be open source" note: users can always build locally even if Steam version exists

#### Medium Priority
- [x] Add "Where to Start" section to Home page: guide users to the tabs with brief tool descriptions
- [x] Rename tabs consistently: Home / World / Assets / Music

#### Low Priority / Future
- [ ] Remove AI/Claude mentions from git history (use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo Cleaner - backup first!)
- [ ] Built-in example browser: open browser window showing bundled maps/models with 3D preview (list left, 3D view right, info bottom)
- [ ] Update itch.io page to reflect the new engine project

---

### Rendering Pipeline

#### Critical
- [x] **Implement PS1 dithering**: The baseline library (tipsy) does NOT include dithering. Add ordered dithering (4x4 Bayer matrix) to the rasterizer. Should be toggleable in `RasterSettings`. Classic PS1 used this to hide color banding with 15-bit color (5 bits per RGB channel)

#### High Priority
- [x] Fix doubled edge lines: In 3D viewport, edges appear as 2 parallel lines instead of 1

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add aspect ratio toggle: Currently locked to PS1 4:3 (320x240), add icon to toggle full available space (affects World Editor and Modeler)

---

### World Editor - 3D Viewport

#### High Priority (Bugs/Polish)
- [x] Show wireframe preview for tile placement: In floor/ceiling mode, display colored wireframe where tile will be placed
- [x] Show sector wireframe on hover: Display vertical lines showing sector boundaries when hovering
- [ ] Add raise/lower for floor/ceiling: Way to adjust Y position when placing tiles
- [ ] Fix texture showing as "(none)": Info pane shows `(none)` even when texture is visible in 3D view
- [ ] Context-sensitive bottom bar: Show left/right click actions; when right-clicking show WASD/QE bindings
- [ ] Unify floor/ceiling as single "horizontal face": Same object, just different spawn height and normal direction
- [ ] Remove "is triangle" display for floors/ceilings: Only relevant for walls

#### Major Features (Missing)
- [ ] **Implement walls functionality**: Currently completely missing
- [ ] **Implement portals**: Create and visualize room connections (Portal struct exists in geometry.rs)
- [ ] **Room boundary wireframe**: Display room size/boundaries as wireframe

#### Future
- [ ] Entity system design: Research TrenchBroom and Tomb Raider Level Editor for spawn points, interactables (ladders, chests, doors), triggers, lights. Each entity type configurable in properties panel

---

### Music Editor

#### High Priority (Bugs)
- [ ] Fix left-side knob reset bug: Knobs reset to max value when dragged on left side
- [ ] Thicken knob perimeter: Circle outline too thin for easy reading
- [ ] Fix piano key highlighting: Clicking works but doesn't show visual feedback
- [ ] Configurable pattern length: Currently hardcoded to 64 rows - should be adjustable
- [ ] Fix Pause icon: Currently shows pen icon instead of pause
- [ ] Fix Arrangement icon: Shows lock instead of arrangement-related icon
- [ ] Fix Instruments icon: Shows rotating arrow - need better icon (piano/synth?)

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add per-note vs channel FX toggle: At top of each channel, toggle between per-note FX or channel-wide FX (with greyed-out section when not active)
- [ ] Add bottom status bar: Same as World Editor, context-sensitive shortcuts/suggestions

#### Future
- [ ] Custom instrument editor: Tab for building custom instruments beyond SF2 soundfonts

---

### Assets

#### High Priority
- [ ] Fix transform tool icons: Select/Move/Rotate/Scale all show the same select icon

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add PS1 aspect ratio toggle: Same feature as World Editor

#### Future
- [ ] Pixel art painting tools: Built-in tools specific for texture painting
- [ ] PS1 color depth constraints: Limit to PS1 palette (toggleable)
- [ ] VRAM usage counter: PS1 had 1MB VRAM (~700-900KB available after screen buffer). Display usage with warning when exceeded
- [ ] Polygon count indicator: Green/yellow/red based on PS1-realistic counts
- [ ] Multi-object animation: Design system for animations where 2 objects interact (e.g., player pulling lever)

---

### PS1 Technical Reference

For implementing authentic PS1 constraints:

**VRAM:**
- Total: 1MB (1,048,576 bytes)
- Screen buffer (320x240x16bit): ~153,600 bytes
- Double buffer: ~307,200 bytes
- Available for textures: ~700-900KB
- Textures typically 4-bit or 8-bit indexed with CLUTs

**Dithering (Bayer 4x4 matrix):**
```
 0/16   8/16   2/16  10/16
12/16   4/16  14/16   6/16
 3/16  11/16   1/16   9/16
15/16   7/16  13/16   5/16
```

## Technical Details

- **Engine**: Custom software rasterizer in Rust
- **UI Framework**: Macroquad for windowing and input
- **Icon Font**: [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for toolbar icons
- **Level Format**: RON (Rust Object Notation)
- **Resolution**: 320x240 (4:3 aspect ratio)
- **Coordinate System**: Y-up, right-handed
- **Sector Size**: 1024 units (TRLE standard)

### WASM Texture Loading

Since WebAssembly can't enumerate directories at runtime, textures are loaded via a manifest system:

1. `build.rs` scans `assets/textures/` at compile time
2. Generates `assets/textures/manifest.txt` listing all packs and files
3. WASM runtime loads textures async from the manifest
4. Native builds still use direct filesystem enumeration

## Acknowledgments

The software rasterizer is based on [tipsy](https://github.com/nkanaev/tipsy), a minimal PS1-style software renderer written in C99 by nkanaev.
